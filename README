I'm a huge Wanda the fish fan and that's why I decided to provide the creature with several other environments it could live in.
The idea is pretty old one. Couple of years ago I made a Windows .NET port. Unfortunately I found only the final executable and not the sources so I need to rewrite it from scratch. I have working PHP version and started putting together an Android app although Google play contains one.

I'll try to compile all the information I've collected and more information about the ports on wandathefish.com

Enjoy!
